    <p>For several years I used <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">Git for Windows</a> to manage
repositories and it proved decent enough. However, I found the Unix-like environment provided by
Git for Windows to be very different than what I am used to with Linux. I have longed for a way
to use Git from WSL to manage my repositories and continue to support tooling that ran on Windows
that interfaced with Git.</p>

<h1 id="whats-the-catch">What’s the catch?</h1>

<p>This assumes that you use SSH keys for authentication. If you use passphrases on your keys then
an ssh-agent should be setup. If you use HTTPS authentication then it will require a workaround
to function in WSL.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>My day to day usage of Git in WSL I have not found a perceptible difference in performance.
Below is a quick comparison of cloning a repository between the two.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone</code> using Git for Windows

  <p>Note: This includes improvements to <a href="/wsl/2019/11/03/wsl_disk_perf.html">WSL Disk performance</a></p>

<h1 id="moving-the-git-configuration-to-wsl">Moving the Git configuration to WSL</h1>

<p>Git for Windows by default uses your user profile directory to store configuration and SSH keys.
Since the systems are mostly the same, you can copy them over to WSL.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd /mnt/c/Users/&lt;your_username&gt;
mv .gitconfig ~
mv .ssh/ ~
</code></pre></div></div>

<h1 id="line-endings">Line Endings</h1>

<p>Git may convert line endings to CRLF on checkout. If you are not paying attention this can cause
some head-scratching during code reviews. Setting autocrlf to <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> will checkout with line
endings left as-is, and will convert them to LF when committing.</p>

<p>Enter the following in your WSL console.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config --global core.autocrlf input
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is recommended that repositories contain <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitattrbutes</code>; a configuration file that defines the
desired line endings that will override the user settings. See 
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings">Configuring Git to Handle Line Endings</a>
for further information on configuration Git Attributes.</p>

<h1 id="use-wsl-git-from-windows">Use WSL Git from Windows</h1>

<p>Using the WSL command line, you can clone, commit, push, etc. without any issues. However, tools from
the Windows side, such as VS Code, will still be calling to Git for Windows for Git operations.
Luckily there is a tool called <a href="https://github.com/andy-5/wslgit">wslgit</a> to forward those calls
to WSL git.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a directory under %programfiles% called <code class="highlighter-rouge">wslgit</code>.</li>
  <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/andy-5/wslgit">wslgit</a> tool and save it under the folder created
earlier.</li>
  <li>Rename <code class="highlighter-rouge">wslgit.exe</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">git.exe</code></li>
  <li>Update the PATH user environment variable to include the path <code class="highlighter-rouge">git.exe</code> under
<code class="highlighter-rouge">%programfiles%\wslgit</code>. If Git for Windows is also in the path make sure this precedes it.</li>
  <li>Create a new user environment variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">WSLGIT_USE_INTERACTIVE_SHELL</code> and set the value to <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, you should be able to run a PowerShell or Windows CMD session and execute <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code>. You
may have to restart an existing session for changes to take effect. When everything appears to be
functional uninstall Git for Windows.</p>
